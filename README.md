# Platform-Specific-Engagement-Optimization-for-AI-Generated-Ghibli-Style-Art

This project explored engagement trends for AI-generated Studio Ghibli-style art across different social media platforms. By analyzing user interactions such as likes, shares, and comments, we identified key drivers of engagement, with likes, shares, and comments being the most influential features. Feature importance and correlation analysis confirmed their dominant role.

Among the tested models, the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) performed best, achieving a training accuracy of 96% and test accuracy of 92%, indicating strong generalization. Hyperparameter tuning further optimized its performance.

The project successfully built an intelligent model that can predict engagement levels and guide creators on what to post, when, and how to optimize visibility. This system can be used to inform posting strategies, platform selection, and content creation to maximize audience interaction with AI-generated artwork.
